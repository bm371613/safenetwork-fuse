SAFE-VFS
========

Overview
--------
1) safenetworkjs is trying to support two APIs (web and node) which have
different auth flows. For now I'm following the node API but...
[ ] when web DOM API is updated add DOM support back to safenetworkjs

2) for safenetwork-fuse auth must be done in the CLI binary
(not safenetwork-fuse) because the executable needs to be invoked a
second time to pass the authUri back to the process which calls openUri().
So...
[ ] merge safecmd.js code into bin.js in order to parse FUSE args and safecmd
    args (and pass CLI args including auth URI and process ID)
[ ] for development, add path of a safe-cli-boilerplate executable
    to appInfo as follows:
      const authCmd = "/home/mrh/src/safe/safe-cli-boilerplate/dist/mock/safecmd"
      const authScript = "/snapshot/safe-cli-boilerplate/safecmd.js"
      appInfo.customExecPath = [
        authCmd, authScript,
        '--pid', String(pid),
        '--uri']

[ ] do the auth before attempting the mount
[ ] on successful auth, call mount and pass in the safeApi and initialised safeApp
[ ] get this to auth with mock network
  NOTE for development I need a built CLI cmd to pass the URI back to this process
[ ] change ./safenetwork-webapi from copies to safenetworkjs (and npm link it)

SafeVfs
=======
SAFE-VFS in the design document is implemented by SafeVfs.

SafeVfs implements the Path Map containing entries which map a path
to a vfsHandler object. The Path Map contains:
- one top level entry for each mount point (e.g. _publicNames, _documents etc.)
- zero or more entries for sub-paths of a top level path entry, that are
  also containers
- provides a getHandler() to get the vfsHandler for a given path (see next)

SafeVfs.getHandler()
--------------------
SafeVfs.getHandler() checks the map for an entry for a given path. If the entry
exists, it returns the entry, a vfsHandler object. If there is no entry
matching the path getHandler() recurses by calling itself on the parent path
and on resolving inserts the returned vfsHandler object into the map.

vfsHandlerObject
----------------
vfsHandlerObject = {
  fuseHandler <vfsFuseHandler>, // Handler for MD role at the leaf of path
                                // (e.g public names, services, NFS service etc

  container <mutableData>,  // The corresponding MD (null if lazy init)
  params <object>           // Params (e.g. as a key in the container if the
                            // mounted path is below the container root)
}

vfsHandler.fuseHandler()
------------------------
This method is called by the FUSE operator implementations. Below is
example SAFE-VFS code for the FUSE readdir operator (implemented in readdir.js):

  module.exports = (safeVfs) => {
    return {
      readdir (path, cb) {
        debug({ path })
        try {
          cb(0, await safeVfs.fuseHandler(path).readdir(path))
          catch (err) {
            err = explain(err, 'Failed to readdir path: ' + path)
            debug(err)
            cb(Fuse.EREMOTEIO)
          }
        })
      }
    }
  }

vfsFuseHandler classes
----------------------
A vfsHandlerObject is an instance of a vfsFuseHandler<type> class, where there
is a type corresponds to the MD container role: PublicNames, Services,
ServiceNfs, ServiceEmail

Each class provides a method for each supported FUSE operation (readdir,
mkdir etc).

newVfsFuseHandler({key, lazyInitialise, {params} })
Another method, newVfsFuseHandler(key) returns a new vfsHandlerObject
corresponding to the MD role of the value at the given key. The new
object will contain any supplied 'params' (such as a key within the
container which they handle), and a 'lazyInitialise' flag which determines
whether to initialise the 'container' member using the API, or set it to
null and return immediately. See vfsHandlerObject above.
